- Point class
- point represent location in x and y coordinate space: pixel locations on screen 
- class: is a data type
- java.awt is a package
- include copy all files while import do not. 
- class hierarchy: java.awt.Point

- constructor: methods with name matching class name
- default constructor: it has no argument: pick default value stored in object or class
eg: Point()  => starts at (0,0)
- call a constructor with "new"
- java doesn't have pointers, it has references
- declaring: Point p1; Point p2, p3;  == drawing memory
- constructing object: p1 = new Point() == pointing to the memory
- p2 = new Point(12,15)
- p3 = new Point(p1) == p1 and new p1 are different: different memories p1 and p3
if p1 changes p3 doesn't even though p3 constructed from p1

- Signature: tells you the name of method, arguments, and return type if it is not a constructor.
- dot notation: to access the method of the object
- encapsulation: all the behaviors for point are inside the class
- method overloading: methods with same name but different args
- strongly typed lang: 
- toString: always called automatically
