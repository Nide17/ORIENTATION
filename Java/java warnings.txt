1. instantiate an object
2. we need to create a new object for every instance object.
3. every method in java must have a return type!

- Create an object: M m = new M("Nide");
- Call constructor only: new M("Nide");

4. Whatever inside double quotes is a string
5. Application or program has always been the main method.
6. When we call a method inside main in the same class, no need for class or object.

7. String type = new String("Hello");
same as String type = "Hello";
