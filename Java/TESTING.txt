TESTING
-------
Test plan: example of inputs and expected outputs

- Bounds: eg: Boundaries, eg against zero < or >: Testing grades boundary 90 and above=A
-- Boundaries: these are the values where the output changes from one letter grade to another.

- Branch: one part of the whole: testing only letter grades instead of the whole system
-- The branch cases are the ones that test each letter grade with a value that is not a bounds test, for instance, 95.0.

- Error: test for unexpected input: eg -92 or negative grade

TEST PLAN: IS COMPOSED OF MORE TEST CASES
TEST CASE: One chunk of testable items

-- The Test plan tests the boundaries with test cases right at the boundary and also with test cases just above and just below the boundary values. 

The expected output for FtoCent: (°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
