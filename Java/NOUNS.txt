NOUNS & VERBS
-------------
- hasa: class has a data member => a class hasa atrributes
- a Point hasa x, hasa y
- names should be NOUNS
- EG: x is a noun, so do y.
- Do hard things later.
- private access modifier, means you cannot access it outside the class.
- Most getters don't have any arguments.
- NB: instead of initializing variables, write a default constructor to do that. Also don't shadow. use different names.
- Method overloading: two methods with same name, different nbr rguments or different classes (types) of arguments.
	- This means, you cannot have two constructors for example 	all taking int arguments.

Two getters
-----------
public int getPoints() {
	return points;
}

public int getMaxPoints() {
	return maxPoints;
}
