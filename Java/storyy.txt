Washing clothes is an activity that I always struggle with doing with my hands. Most of the time I wash clothes on weekends. I always find it hard to finish it because it takes me a lot of time and energy. In addition, when I finish my back always aches.

Today, with my teammates we have identified steps used in washing clothes using a washing machine. The first step is to set up the inputs which include the washing machine, the laundry basket, clothes, detergents, dryer, water, and electricity. Secondly, is to start processing the washing that has sub-processes including sorting and separating clothes according to their colors, cloth material, and dirtiness. Then, set up the washing machine by plugging it into the power outlet; then add the required detergents and water. Then put the first group of clothes into the machine's drawer to start washing and wait until it's finished. repeat the previous task until all clothes have been washed. After all, all clothes are washed, use the dryer to make them dry. Lastly, the output is having all your clothes clean and ready to wore.
