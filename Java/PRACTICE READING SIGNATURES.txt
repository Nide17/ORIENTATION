PRACTICE READING SIGNATURES
------------------------------------------
1. Signature: Monster(String type, String name, double weight)     Class: Monster


Call: Monster object = new Monster(); => This is a Default constructor, set instance variables to their default values.

True answer: 
String type = "Ghost";
String name = "XYZ";
double weight = 20.0;

Monster m = new Monster(type, name, weight);


2. Signature: public void eat(Rectangle r, int num)        Class: Monster

Object: Monster object = new Monster();

Call: object.eat(r, num); => The eat method is called using object name since it is a regular generic method.




3. Signature: public void paint(Graphics g)         Class: Line 

Object: Line object = new Line();

Call: object.paint(g); => paint method is also regular, so we need an object to call it.

True Answer: 

public void paint(Graphics g) {

// we need the Line object
Line l = new Line();

// no need for Graphics object bcz is given as g
l.paint(g);
}



4. Signature: Line(Point p1, Point p2)         Class: Line 

Call: Line object = new Line(); => we are are calling the default constructor here as instructed hence Line is the constructor.




5. Signature: Line(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)        Class: Line 

Call: Line object =  new Line(); => we are calling the default constructor here as instructed of the Line class to set the default values.




6. Signature: public Receipt getMoney(double amount, String PIN)        Class: ATM 
- returns a Receipt object
- Receipt also is an object created inside getMoney() to be returned. no need to create a new Receipt

Object: ATM object = new ATM(); // call the default

Call: object.getMoney(amount, PIN); => we need to create an object of ATM in order to call getMoney method since it is a regular generic method of ATM class.

True answer: object.getMoney(7000, "ABCDE");
- We also need to store the value returned
Receipt r = object.getMoney(7000, "ABCDE");


7. Signature: public void swim(double speed)        Class: JellyFish 

Object: JellyFish object = new JellyFish();

Call: object.swim(speed); => To call swim method, we need to get the JellyFish object first hence the swim method is generic one.




8. Signature: public static double refund(int year)        Class: TaxForm

Call: TaxForm.refund(year); => refund is a static method, hence it is called by class name followed by dot and method name. 

True Answer: double amount = refund(2022);
- This is because the refund method is in the same class as the main method.
